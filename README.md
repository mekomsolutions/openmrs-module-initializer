## Introduction
The Initializer module is an API-only module that processes the content of the **configuration** folder when it is found inside OpenMRS' application data directory:

<pre>
.
├── modules/
├── openmrs.war
├── openmrs-runtime.properties
├── ...
└── <b>configuration/</b>
</pre>
The configuration folder is subdivided into _domain_ subfolders:
```bash
configuration/
  ├── addresshierarchy/
  ├── ampathforms/
  ├── ampathformstranslations/
  ├── appointmentspecialities/
  ├── appointmentservicedefinitions/
  ├── appointmentservicetypes/
  ├── attributetypes/
  ├── autogenerationoptions/
  ├── bahmniforms/
  ├── billableservices/
  ├── cashpoints/
  ├── cohorttypes/
  ├── cohortattributetypes/
  ├── conceptclasses/
  ├── conceptsources/
  ├── concepts/
  ├── conceptsets/
  ├── datafiltermappings/
  ├── drugs/
  ├── encountertypes/

  ├── paymentmodes/
  ├── patientidentifiertypes/ 
  ├── personattributetypes/ 
  ├── privileges/ 
  ├── programs/ 
  ├── programworkflows/
  ├── programworkflowstates/
  ├── providerroles/
  ├── queues/
  ├── relationshiptypes/
  └── roles/
   
```  
Each domain-specific subfolder contains OpenMRS metadata configuration files that pertains to the domain.

## Goals
* This module loads an OpenMRS configuration consisting of OpenMRS metadata.
* CSV files are the preferred format, however a number of metadata domains rely on other file formats. See the list [below](#supported-domains-and-default-loading-order) for details.
* Initializer processes all configuration files upon starting up.
* Initializer produces a checksum file for each processed configuration file. A file will never be processed again until its checksum has changed.
  * See more info [here](readme/checksums.md) about checksums.
* Each line of those CSV files represents an **OpenMRS metadata entity to be created, edited or retired**.
* Each line of those CSV files follows the WYSIWYG principle.

## Releases notes

#### Version 2.8.0
* Ampath forms translation files will now generate checksums.
* Enhancement to ensure that when an Ampath forms file is loaded, a new resource with the existing Ampath forms translations is created.
* Added support for 'billing' (billableservices, paymentmodes, cashpoints) domains.

#### Version 2.7.0
* Added support for 'queues' domain.
* Added support for 'addresshierarchy' domain.
* Fix for Liquibase Loader to ensure compatibility with OpenMRS versions 2.5.5+.
* Fix for OCL Loader to ensure it throws an Exception if the OCL import fails.
* Fix for Validator to not encounter failure upon repeated execution on the same JVM process.
* Fix for null config directory path in `DeleteDomainChecksumsChangeset`.

#### Version 2.6.0
* Added support for 'cohorttypes' and 'cohortattributetypes' domains.

#### Version 2.5.2
* Updated versions of Validator's metadatamapping to 1.6.0 and metadatasharing to 1.9.0.

#### Version 2.5.1
* Enhanced Validator to prevent random failures because of `LazyInitializationException`, and better teardown cleanup for uses with Maven plugins such as [openmrs-packager-maven-plugin](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-contrib-packager-maven-plugin) 1.7.0.

#### Version 2.5.0
* Added support for AMPATH Forms translations, see https://github.com/mekomsolutions/openmrs-module-initializer/issues/180 and https://github.com/mekomsolutions/openmrs-module-initializer/issues/221
* Fix for Message Source when system default language is not English, see https://github.com/mekomsolutions/openmrs-module-initializer/issues/212
* Logging now uses the configured level as a minimum.
* Added support for [drug reference maps](https://github.com/mekomsolutions/openmrs-module-initializer/issues/219) on the drugs domain.

#### Version 2.4.0
* Added support for 'fhirconceptsources' domain.
* Added support for 'fhirpatientidentifiersystems' domain.
* Enhancement to ensure that reloading Concept CSVs does not clear Members/Answers if those columns aren't part of CSV file.
* 'concepts' domain to support a new expandable `MAPPINGS` header, thereby discouraging the older `Same as mappings`.
* Concept references expanded to allow use of concept names in locales other than the default system locale.

#### Version 2.3.0
* Added configuration options for logging.
* Added support for OpenMRS 2.4.0+
* Added support for a 'liquibase' domain to support loading custom changesets.
* 'ocl' domain to support loading concepts, concept sets and answers from OCL export files in **configuration/ocl**.
* (_Enhancement_) Concept name UUIDs are seeded from 1) the concept UUID and 2) the concept name information, see [here](readme/concepts.md#implicit-handling-of-concept-names). This version runs a Liquibase changeset that forces a reload of the concept domain in order to update concept names accordingly.
* Backward-compatible overhaul of the concepts domain that provides full flexibility for managing concept names.
* Bulk loading of metadata entities i18n display messages specified under `display:xy` headers.
* (_For devs._) Introduced a pre-loading mechanism to `BaseFileLoader` that allows checksums-independent loading of transient information out of the config files before the actual metadata are loaded. Each loader controls whether its pre-loader throws on error or is allowed to fail. By default pre-loaders are allowed to fail.
* Added support for setting the version property in the 'concepts' domain.
* Bulk creation and editing of concept set members and concept answers using CSV files in **configuration/conceptsets**.
* Added support enabling any Initializer runtime property value to also be specified from a system property.
* Bulk creation and edition of AMPATH forms provided as JSON schema definitions in **configuration/ampathforms**.
* Enhancement to Initializer's custom message source to support improved handling of fallback locales and overrides between messages properties file from core, modules, and Initializer 'messageproperties' domain files.
* Added support for remote sources and identifier pools to the 'idgen' domain.
* Enhancement to ensure predictable loading order of files within a domain if no explicit order is specified, based on alphabetical ordering of filenames.
* Enhancement to the 'messageproperties' domain to enable specifying the order in which two files in the same locale should be loaded.

#### Version 2.2.0
* 'attributetypes' domain to support Bahmni program attribute types.
* 'program' domain to support `Name` and `Description` headers.
* CSV parsers to actually fill _new_ objects marked to be retired or voided before creating them as retired/voided entities.
* Added a runtime property to define the loading startup mode for the activator OpenMRS config loading process.
* Existing attributes and location tags which are not specified in CSV headers are no longer removed.  
* Bulk creation and editing of concept sources provided as CSV files in **configuration/conceptsources**.
* Bulk creation and editing of encounter roles using CSV files in **configuration/encounterroles**.

* (_For devs._) Introduced `CsvFailingLines` for a better management of the outcome of `CsvParser#process`.
* Introduced safe and unsafe API modes to suit either app runtime loading or early failure loading for CI.
* (_For devs._) Introduced `BaseFileLoader` and `BaseInputStreamLoader` as part of a better streamlined loading framework.
* _Initialize Validator_ a standalone fatjar to make dry runs of OpenMRS configs.
* Nested structures of configuration files are supported.
