# OpenMRS Initializer module
### Introduction
The Initializer module is an API-only module that processes the content of the **configuration** folder when it is found inside OpenMRS' application data directory:

<pre>
.
├── modules/
├── openmrs.war
├── openmrs-runtime.properties
├── ...
└── <b>configuration/</b>
</pre>
The configuration folder is subdivided into _domain_ subfolders:
```bash
configuration/
  ├── addresshierarchy/
  ├── concepts/
  ├── drugs/
  ├── globalproperties/
  ├── idgen/
  ├── jsonkeyvalues/
  ├── locations/
  ├── messageproperties/
  ├── metadatasharing/ 
  ├── personattributetypes/ 
  ├── privileges/ 
  ├── programs/ 
  ├── programworkflows/
  ├── programworkflowstates/
  └── roles/
```  
Each domain-specific subfolder contains the metadata and configuration information that is relevant to the subfolder's domain. Although several file types are supported for providing metadata, CSV files are the preferred format and all domain should aim at being covered through parsing CSV files.

### Objectives
* This module allows to preload an OpenMRS installation with **maintained and versioned data and metadata**.
* Initializer processes **CSV files** upon startup.
* Each line of those CSV files represents an **OpenMRS object to be created or edited**.

Even though using CSV files is the preferred approach, some data or metadata domains rely on other file formats to be imported. You will encounter those other formats in the list below.

### Supported domains and loading order
We suggest to go through the following before looking at specific import domains:
* [Conventions for CSV files](readme/csv_conventions.md)

This is the list of currently supported domains in respect to their loading order:
1. [Message properties key-values (.properties files)](readme/messageproperties.md)
1. [Generic JSON key-values (JSON files)](readme/jsonkeyvalues.md)
1. [Metadatasharing packages (ZIP files)](readme/mds.md)
1. [Privileges (CSV files)](readme/priv.md)
1. [Global properties (XML files)](readme/globalproperties.md)
1. [Locations (CSV files)](readme/loc.md)
1. [Concepts (CSV files)](readme/concepts.md)
1. [Programs (CSV files)](readme/prog.md)
1. [Programs worklows (CSV files)](readme/prog.md)
1. [Programs worklow states (CSV files)](readme/prog.md)
1. [Person attribute types (CSV files)](readme/pat.md)
1. [Identifier sources (CSV files)](readme/idgen.md)
1. [Drugs (CSV files)](readme/drugs.md)
1. [Order Frequencies(CSV files)](readme/freqs.md)

### How to try it out?
Build the master branch and install the built OMOD to your OpenMRS instance:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mekomsolutions/openmrs-module-initializer/tree/master
cd openmrs-module-initializer
mvn clean install
```
##### Runtime requirements & compatibility
* Core 1.11.9

### Quick facts
Initializer enables to achieve the OpenMRS backend equivalent of Bahmni Config for Bahmni Apps. It facilitates the deployment of implementation-specific configurations without writing any code, by just filling the **configuration** folder with the needed metadata and in accordance to Initializer's available implementations.
