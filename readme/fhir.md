## Domain 'fhirconceptsources'

The **fhirconceptsources** subfolder contains CSV import files for defining concept source URLs for any concept sources in
your dictionary. In OpenMRS, we tend to refer to concepts using mappings, e.g., SNOMED CT:1234. In FHIR, these mappings are
represented as two properties: a `system`, defined by a URL, and a code. The corresponding FHIR representation of the
previous mapping would be:

```json
{
  "system": "http://snomed.info/sct",
  "code": "1234"
}
```

By adding entries to this table, you enable the FHIR API to return concepts mapped to that concept source as responses
wherever concepts can be displayed.

This is a possible example of its contents:
```bash
fhirconceptsources/
  ├──conceptsources.csv
  └── ...
```

The format of this CSV should be as follows:

| <sub>Uuid</sub> |<sub>Void/Retire</sub> | <sub>Concept source</sub> | <sub>Url</sub> | <sub>_order:1000</sub> |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| <sub>befca738-1704-4a47-9f6a-0fcacf786061</sub> | | <sub>CIEL</sub> | <sub>https://api.openconceptlab.org/orgs/CIEL/sources/CIEL</sub> | |

Headers that start with an underscore such as `_order:1000` are metadata headers. The values in the columns under those headers are never read by the CSV parser.

###### Header `Concept source`

This is *required* for every entry and is what is used to identify the underlying concept source.  This can refer to the name (if unique), hl7Code, uniqueId, or uuid of the concept source that this entry refers to. This must refer to an existing Concept source entry, added via the conceptsources domain.  This will not create or modify the underlying concept source. The name of this underlying concept source will be used as the name of the FHIR concept source.

###### Header `Url`

This is the URL of the code system in FHIR. For terminologies identified
[in the FHIR CodeSystem registry](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/terminologies-systems.html), this should be the preferred URL for
that code system, e.g. SNOMED CT is "http://snomed.info/sct". If the code system is not defined by HL7 or that table, then
the code systems own preferred URL should be used, e.g., for CIEL we tend to use
"https://api.openconceptlab.org/orgs/CIEL/sources/CIEL".

## Domain 'fhirpatientidentifiersystems'

The **fhirpatientidentifiersystems** subfolder contains CSV import files for defining identifier system URLs for any patient
identifier types in your OpenMRS instance. These system identifiers are used in data exchange to disambiguate between different
identifiers a patient may have. If none are provided, the identifier type UUID is used as the "system" for these identifiers.

This is a possible example of its contents:
```bash
fhirpatientidentifiersystems/
  ├──identifiersystems.csv
  └── ...
```

The format of this CSV should be as follows:

| <sub>Uuid</sub> |<sub>Void/Retire</sub> | <sub>Patient identifier type</sub> | <sub>Url</sub> | <sub>_order:1000</sub> |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| <sub>87c87473-b394-430b-93d3-b46d0faca26e</sub> | | <sub>OpenMRS ID</sub> | <sub>http://openmrs.org/identifier</sub> | |

Headers that start with an underscore such as `_order:1000` are metadata headers. The values in the columns under those headers are never read by the CSV parser.

###### Header `Patient identifier type`

This is *required* for every entry and is what is used to identify the underlying patient identifier type.  This can refer to the name (if unique) or uuid of the patient identifier type that this entry refers to. This must refer to an existing Patient Identifier Type, added via the patientidentifiertypes domain.  This will not create or modify the underlying patient identifier types. The name of this underlying patient identifier type will be used as the name of the FHIR patient identifier system.

###### Header `Url`

This is the URL of the code system in FHIR. For terminologies identified
[in the FHIR CodeSystem registry](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/terminologies-systems.html), this should be the preferred URL for
that code system, e.g. SNOMED CT is "http://snomed.info/sct". If the code system is not defined by HL7 or that table, then
the code systems own preferred URL should be used, e.g., for CIEL we tend to use
"https://api.openconceptlab.org/orgs/CIEL/sources/CIEL".

## Domain 'fhirContactPointMap'

The **fhirContactPointMap** subfolder contains CSV import files for defining contact point fields like system, use, rank for any of person, provider and location in your OpenMRS instance. 
These are used in data exchange to store contact attributes a person, provider or location may have. If none are provided, the identifier type UUID is used as the "system" for these attributes.

This is a possible example of its contents:
```bash
fhirContactPointMap/
  ├──contactPointMap.csv
  └── ...
```
The format of this CSV should be as follows:

| <sub>Uuid</sub> |<sub>Void/Retire</sub> | <sub>Attribute Type Domain</sub> | <sub>Attribute Type</sub> | <sub>System</sub> | <sub>Use</sub> | <sub>Rank</sub> | <sub>_order:1000</sub> |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| <sub>person</sub> | | <sub>Phone Number</sub> | | <sub>phone</sub> | | <sub>home</sub> | |<sub>1</sub> | 

Headers that start with an underscore such as `_order:1000` are metadata headers. The values in the columns under those headers are never read by the CSV parser.

###### Attribute Type Domain(mandatory)
This is a *required* field for every entry. This can either be person, provider or location which represent the **Person Attribute Type**, **Provider Attribute Type** and **Location Attribute Type** respectively.

###### System(mandatory)

This can be any of phone, fax, email, pager, url, sms. Take a look at [ContactPointSystem](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-contact-point-system.html) for more information.

###### Use(mandatory)

This represents the actual purpose of the contact point. It could be any of home ,work ,temp ,old ,mobile. Take a deeper look at [ContactPointUse](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-contact-point-use.html).

###### Rank(mandatory)

This specifies the preferred order of use (1 = highest).
