## Domain 'ampathformstranslations'
The **ampathtranslationsforms** subfolder contains AMPATH Translation Forms JSON schema files. Each JSON file defines the translations for forms. For example,

```bash
ampathformstranslations/
  ├── form1_translations_fr.json
  └── form2_translations_en.json
```

###### JSON file example:
```json
{
    "uuid": "c5bf3efe-3798-4052-8dcb-09aacfcbabdc",
    "form": "Form 1",
    "form_name_translation": "Formulaire 1",
    "description": "French Translations for Form 1",
    "language": "fr",
    "translations": {
      "Encounter": "Rencontre",
      "Other": "Autre",
      "Child": "Enfant"
    }
}
```

**NOTE:** 
* The `form` attribute must be provided with an existing form name for the translations to load successfully. The translations form resources get names following the following pattern `<form_name>_translations_<language>`.
* The `form_name_translation` attribute is treated as the localized name for the form in the translation locale.
