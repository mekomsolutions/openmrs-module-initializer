## Domain 'ocl'
The **ocl** subfolder contains JSON file of OCL dictionary packages as .zip files to be imported. This is a possible example of its content:
```bash
ocl/
  └── test.zip
```
The JSON file inside .zip file loads all the concepts exported from OCL.
<br/>OCL package is a convenient way to load all the concepts to the dictionary.
